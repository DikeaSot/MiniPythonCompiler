# MiniPython Compiler
Assignment for Compilers AUEB course. Winter Semester 2019-20

---

## Project Description
The aim of this assignment is to implement a compiler for miniPython language.

## MiniPython Language
MiniPython is a subset of Python and so, the content of a program in miniPython is the same with the content of the same program in Python.

You will be using the tool [SableCC](http://www.sablecc.org/), which will make it easier for you to construct the compiler.
Additional information can be found on the book Modern Compiler Implementation in Java, Andrew W. Appel.

### Supported Commands
- Integer, decimal and string assignment to variables
- List assignment to variables
- Function declaration with simple arguements or with default values
- If, print, while, for commands
- Function calls
- Single-line commands
